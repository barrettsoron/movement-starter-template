Welcome to the Movement Starter Template! This platform is designed to amplify voices, organize actions, and build community power.

## Why This Template?

Progressive movements need accessible, secure, and rapidly-deployable digital infrastructure. This template provides:

- **Accessibility-first design** ensuring everyone can participate
- **Privacy-respecting technology** that protects our communities
- **Rapid deployment** so you can focus on organizing, not technical setup

## Get Involved

Whether you're sharing stories, organizing events, or mobilizing supporters, this platform is built for movement builders like you.

Together, we build the world we want to see.
